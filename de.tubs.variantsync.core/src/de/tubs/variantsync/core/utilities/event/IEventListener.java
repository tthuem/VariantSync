/**
 * Interface for components listening to events fired by other components. <br/> Some classes of FeatureIDE use the observer-pattern, to notify listening
 * clients. For instance, a feature model fires a "model data changed" event when the model is changed. Listening clients, e.g., the diagram editor can react on
 * this event. <br/> <br/> The follow sketch outlines the observer-pattern usage in FeatureIDE, taken
 * {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.ui.editors.FeatureDiagramEditor} and {@link FeatureModel} as example. <code><pre> IEventListener <--- propertyChange is called
 * --------- | | | | implements fires event | | V | Receiver -- register as listener ---> Sender </pre></code> <br/> Please note that events fired and received
 * over this interface are from type {@link VariantSyncEvent}.
