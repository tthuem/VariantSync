			VariantSync is a tool to develop variants separately as in clone-and-own and to
			automate change propagation by using domain knowledge of developers.
			VariantSync detects and logs changes during development, tags these
			changes to feature expressions and automates the synchronization of
			changes between variants. As a side effect, using VariantSync for a
			while may increase the feature-to-code map-ping and, thus, ease a
			potential later migration to a product line. VariantSync is an
			open-source Eclipse plug-in distributed under L-GPL.
